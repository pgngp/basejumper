# Basejumper

Note: This is an old program that I developed several years ago for viewing genome assembly data while I was working at St. Jude.

Basejumper is a desktop-based browser for genome assembly data. It is designed to read in assembled DNA sequences in ACE format from massively parallel (or “next-generation”) sequencing experiments (Illumina/Solexa and Roche/454).
